/**
 * A source that starts a flow run in response to something external — a
 * cron tick, a host application event, an inbound HTTP request. Every
 * trigger type owns its OWN registration and input-mapping logic;
 * `fire()` is the single shared seam that hands the already-mapped input
 * to the core engine (a trivial `Flow::dispatch($flowName, $input,
 * $options)` call — a shared implementation trait is not warranted until
 * a second/third concrete trigger actually needs one).
 *
 * `fire()` mirrors `Flow::dispatch()`'s own fire-and-forget contract
 * exactly: it queues a run and returns nothing synchronously — no run id
 * is available at trigger time (`Flow::dispatch()` itself returns the
 * queue dispatcher's `mixed` result, which callers must not rely on as a
 * run identifier). A trigger that needs the resulting run id must read it
 * back later (e.g. via `FlowDashboardReadModel`), not from `fire()`.
